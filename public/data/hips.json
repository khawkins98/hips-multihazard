Given the complex structure and functioning of ecosystems, and the multitude of pressures they face (Cloern, 2001), the precise definition of eutrophication remains to be established (Pannard et al., 2024).","altLabels":["Nutrient pollution"],"typeId":"https://www.preventionweb.net/hips-type/environmental","typeName":"Environmental","clusterId":"https://www.preventionweb.net/hips-cluster/environmental-degradation","clusterName":"Environmental Degradation","scopeNotes":{},"causes":["https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/ch0100","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/ch0300","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/ch0601","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/ch0603","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/bi0603"],"causedBy":["https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/ch0500","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/mh0602","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/mh0603","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/en0106","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/en0201","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/en0304","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/tl0214","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/tl0205","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/tl0501"],"sources":["#definitionSource1","#definitionSource2","https://coastalscience.noaa.gov/project/national-estuarine-eutrophication-assessment-update","#definitionSource4","https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/6325/15wg420_inf10_eng.pdf"],"quotedFrom":["#definitionSource1","#definitionSource2","https://coastalscience.noaa.gov/project/national-estuarine-eutrophication-assessment-update","#definitionSource4","https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/6325/15wg420_inf10_eng.pdf"],"references":["https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envc.2023.100733","https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-805052-1.00021-8","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmarsys.2011.11.001","https://doi.org/10.1002/etc.3220","https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/eutrophication-causes-consequences-and-controls-in-aquatic-102364466/#:~:text=The%20known%20consequences%20of%20cultural,of%20recreational%20opportunities%2C%20and%20hypoxia","https://doi.org/10.1111%2F1752-1688.12711","https://doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(85)90146-0","https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/885416f2-bf5d-43f3-9785-748542fa3a9e/content","https://doi.org/10.29327/multi.2019007","https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-89990-3.50054-7","https://preventive-medicine.imedpub.com/causes-and-consequences-of-eutrophication-which-are-leading-to-water-pollution.php?aid=41297","https://doi.org/10.1579/0044-7447-29.4.202","https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1012283603339","https://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/fac_articles/562","https://doi.org/10.1080/00785236.1995.10422046","#descriptionSource16","https://doi.org/10.4319/lo.1991.36.7.1457","https://journals.openedition.org/teoros/139","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2017.02.010","https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.12201","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0426.1994.tb00165.x","https://doi.org/10.1006/eesa.2001.2083","https://www.unwater.org/publications/un-world-water-development-report-2015","https://www.un-ilibrary.org/content/books/9789216040062","https://doi.org/10.1038/nature11655","https://doi.org/10.1631%2Fjzus.B0710626"],"influencedBy":["https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envc.2023.100733","https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-805052-1.00021-8","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmarsys.2011.11.001","https://doi.org/10.1002/etc.3220","https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/eutrophication-causes-consequences-and-controls-in-aquatic-102364466/#:~:text=The%20known%20consequences%20of%20cultural,of%20recreational%20opportunities%2C%20and%20hypoxia","https://doi.org/10.1111%2F1752-1688.12711","https://doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(85)90146-0","https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/885416f2-bf5d-43f3-9785-748542fa3a9e/content","https://doi.org/10.29327/multi.2019007","https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-89990-3.50054-7","https://preventive-medicine.imedpub.com/causes-and-consequences-of-eutrophication-which-are-leading-to-water-pollution.php?aid=41297","https://doi.org/10.1579/0044-7447-29.4.202","https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1012283603339","https://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/fac_articles/562","https://doi.org/10.1080/00785236.1995.10422046","#descriptionSource16","https://doi.org/10.4319/lo.1991.36.7.1457","https://journals.openedition.org/teoros/139","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2017.02.010","https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.12201","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0426.1994.tb00165.x","https://doi.org/10.1006/eesa.2001.2083","https://www.unwater.org/publications/un-world-water-development-report-2015","https://www.un-ilibrary.org/content/books/9789216040062","https://doi.org/10.1038/nature11655","https://doi.org/10.1631%2Fjzus.B0710626"],"conformsTo":[],"hasPart":["#diagram1"],"related":[],"versionInfo":"2025 update;

The destruction of mangrove habitat is caused by both human and natural causes. Humans have cleared mangrove forests to expand farmlands, aquaculture ponds or urban areas. Natural stressors, such as sediment erosion, extreme storm surges or drought have also resulted in mangrove habitat loss. The loss of mangroves has devastated coastal communities, which depend on them for socio-economic activities and environmental conservation, especially in regions with low mangrove diversity and coverage.","altLabels":["Mangrove loss","Mangrove deforestation"],"typeId":"https://www.preventionweb.net/hips-type/environmental","typeName":"Environmental","clusterId":"https://www.preventionweb.net/hips-cluster/environmental-degradation","clusterName":"Environmental Degradation","scopeNotes":{},"causes":["https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/en0501","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/mh0601","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/gh0405"],"causedBy":["https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/gh0309","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/tl0302","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/tl0403","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/en0106","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/en0201","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/en0204","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/en0402","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/so0202","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/mh0309","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/mh0401","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/mh0708"],"sources":["https://www.doc-developpement-durable.org/file/Culture/Arbres-Bois-de-Rapport-Reforestation/mangrove/mangroves.pdf"],"quotedFrom":["https://www.doc-developpement-durable.org/file/Culture/Arbres-Bois-de-Rapport-Reforestation/mangrove/mangroves.pdf"],"references":["https://doi.org/10.1007/s40641-015-0002-x","https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14153657","https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1118387","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314967065_Large-scale_dieback_of_mangroves_in_Australia","https://doi.org/10.4060/cc7044en","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-011-0289-6_10","http://www.globalmangrovewatch.org/","https://doi.org/10.3389/feart.2019.00261","https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15275","https://bvearmb.do/handle/123456789/2479","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2017.00143","https://www.jstor.org/stable/2096879","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-61136-6","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0107706","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40152-022-00274-1","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0010095","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11368-023-03503-0","https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abn1479","https://www.undrr.org/publication/sendai-framework-disaster-risk-reduction-2015-2030","https://www.unesco.org/en/legal-affairs/convention-wetlands-international-importance-especially-waterfowl-habitat","#descriptionSource21","https://www.unep.org/resources/report/importance-mangroves-people-call-action","https://www.unesco.org/en/biodiversity/wetlands","https://sdgs.un.org/goals","https://api.repository.cam.ac.uk/server/api/core/bitstreams/a48758ae-9956-4c5f-96ba-d20d5c1e183e/content","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oneear.2020.04.018","https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/generalassembly/docs/globalcompact/A_RES_71_257.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2023.106866"],"influencedBy":["https://doi.org/10.1007/s40641-015-0002-x","https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14153657","https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1118387","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314967065_Large-scale_dieback_of_mangroves_in_Australia","https://doi.org/10.4060/cc7044en","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-011-0289-6_10","http://www.globalmangrovewatch.org/","https://doi.org/10.3389/feart.2019.00261","https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15275","https://bvearmb.do/handle/123456789/2479","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2017.00143","https://www.jstor.org/stable/2096879","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-61136-6","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0107706","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40152-022-00274-1","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0010095","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11368-023-03503-0","https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abn1479","https://www.undrr.org/publication/sendai-framework-disaster-risk-reduction-2015-2030","https://www.unesco.org/en/legal-affairs/convention-wetlands-international-importance-especially-waterfowl-habitat","#descriptionSource21","https://www.unep.org/resources/report/importance-mangroves-people-call-action","https://www.unesco.org/en/biodiversity/wetlands","https://sdgs.un.org/goals","https://api.repository.cam.ac.uk/server/api/core/bitstreams/a48758ae-9956-4c5f-96ba-d20d5c1e183e/content","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oneear.2020.04.018","https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/generalassembly/docs/globalcompact/A_RES_71_257.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2023.106866"],"conformsTo":[],"hasPart":["#diagram1"],"related":[],"versionInfo":"2025 update; https://www.undrr.org/publication/2025-update-undrr-isc-hazard-information-profiles-hips","rights":"Creative Commons CC BY 4.0"},{"id":"https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/en0401","label":"Ocean Acidification","identifier":"EN0401","definition":"Ocean acidification refers to a reduction in the pH of the ocean over an extended period, caused primarily by the uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

Saline soils are those with an elevated amount of soluble salts, which reduces the ability of plants to take up water from soil due to the high osmotic pressure of the soil solution (FAO, 1985).\nThe technical criteria used to distinguish saline soil from other soils is the electrical conductivity (ECe) of a soil paste saturation extract: ECe > 2 dS/m (slightly saline) or ECe > 4 dS/m (saline) at 25 C. The content of soluble salts should be higher than 0.1-0.2% (FAO, 2018). The threshold of salinity above which a plant will suffer deleterious effects varies according to plant species, type of ions in solution, soil health and soil fertility status.\nSodic soils get their name from sodium ions (Na⁺) adsorbed on soil clays and organic matter. Sodic soils have elevated amounts of exchangeable Na⁺ compared to the amounts of Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺, measured as sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) > 13 or exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) > 15, and with

(WHO, 2019) The release of hydrocarbon ground gases, such as methane, can lead to major public hazards.","altLabels":["Paraffins","olefins","acetylenes","aromatic compounds","saturated hydrocarbons","unsaturated hydrocarbons","petrochemicals","benzol","phenyl hydride","cyclohexatriene","arene","coal naptha"],"typeId":"https://www.preventionweb.net/hips-type/chemical","typeName":"Chemical","clusterId":"https://www.preventionweb.net/hips-cluster/carcinogens","clusterName":"Carcinogens","scopeNotes":{},"causes":["https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/tl0301","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/tl0303","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/tl0304","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/tl0305"],"causedBy":["https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/gh0407","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/en0101","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/tl0301","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/tl0509"],"sources":["https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/329481/WHO-CED-PHE-EPE-19.4.2-eng.pdf?ua=1"],"quotedFrom":["https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/329481/WHO-CED-PHE-EPE-19.4.2-eng.pdf?ua=1"],"references":["https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/national-primary-drinking-water-regulations#Organics","https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02006R1907-20140410","https://chemicalsafety.ilo.org/dyn/icsc/showcard.display?p_lang=en%26p_card_id=0015%26p_version=2","http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:C136","http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc150.htm","https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/default.html","https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/ocean-coasts/oil-spills","https://www.osha.gov/chemicaldata/","https://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol?gad_source=1%26gclid=Cj0KCQjw6oi4BhD1ARIsAL6pox2fTQl-EbOEXaXo1WuL2HWpo7FRe3qFD-FZHZdSofXBTvOsuQtuVikaArD4EALw_wcB","https://unece.org/transport/dangerous-goods/ghs-rev10-2023","https://www.basel.int/theconvention/overview/tabid/1271/default.aspx","https://www.pic.int/","https://chm.pops.int/","https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/42811/9241591013.pdf;jsessionid=1E987E56292F6623A337129E2C1D0E27?sequence=1","https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/246107/9789241580496-eng.pdf?sequence=1","https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/329481/WHO-CED-PHE-EPE-19.4.2-eng.pdf?ua=1"],"influencedBy":["https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/national-primary-drinking-water-regulations#Organics","https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02006R1907-20140410","https://chemicalsafety.ilo.org/dyn/icsc/showcard.display?p_lang=en%26p_card_id=0015%26p_version=2","http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:C136","http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc150.htm","https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/default.html","https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/ocean-coasts/oil-spills","https://www.osha.gov/chemicaldata/","https://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol?gad_source=1%26gclid=Cj0KCQjw6oi4BhD1ARIsAL6pox2fTQl-EbOEXaXo1WuL2HWpo7FRe3qFD-FZHZdSofXBTvOsuQtuVikaArD4EALw_wcB","https://unece.org/transport/dangerous-goods/ghs-rev10-2023","https://www.basel.int/theconvention/overview/tabid/1271/default.aspx","https://www.pic.int/","https://chm.pops.int/","https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/42811/9241591013.pdf;jsessionid=1E987E56292F6623A337129E2C1D0E27?sequence=1","https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/246107/9789241580496-eng.pdf?sequence=1","https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/329481/WHO-CED-PHE-EPE-19.4.2-eng.pdf?ua=1"],"conformsTo":["https://unece.org/transport/dangerous-goods/ghs-rev10-2023"],"hasPart":["#diagram1"],"related":["https://unece.org/transport/dangerous-goods/ghs-rev10-2023#GHS02","https://unece.org/transport/dangerous-goods/ghs-rev10-2023#GHS07","https://unece.org/transport/dangerous-goods/ghs-rev10-2023#GHS08"],"versionInfo":"2025 update; https://www.undrr.org/publication/2025-update-undrr-isc-hazard-information-profiles-hips","rights":"Creative Commons CC BY 4.0"},{"id":"https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/ch0102","label":"Cadmium","identifier":"CH0102","definition":"Cadmium is a toxic heavy metal which is widely distributed in the Earth’s crust (soil and rocks), air and water; however, human activity has greatly increased levels in environmental media relevant to population exposure.

Some water supplies are fluoridated in order to achieve improved dental health.\nIodine is a non-metallic element essential for the human body, as it is a crucial component of thyroid hormones, which regulate various metabolic processes, including growth and energy expenditure. Iodine, usually as iodide salts in the diet, is absorbed throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Iodine is essential for healthy brain development in the foetus and young child. A deficiency in iodine can lead to thyroid gland problems, such as goitre and hypothyroidism. Iodine deficiency negatively affects the health of women, as well as economic productivity and quality of life (WHO, 2023).

Biological significance would include elements that are essential or toxic to any organism; some elements can be both, depending on their concentration. Many of the trace elements of importance are metals, while others are metalloids, alloys, non-metals, actinoids, and halogens occurring in a variety of chemical states (elemental, cations, anions, oxyanions, methylated, etc.). This category can overlap or be used synonymously with terms such as potentially toxic elements, heavy metals, persistent inorganic contaminants, and inorganic contaminants, and halides, such as fluoride and iodide.

It is most frequently the result of storm surges and high winds coinciding with high tides. The surge itself is the result of the raising of sea levels due to low atmospheric pressure. In particular configurations, such as major estuaries or confined sea areas, the piling up of water is amplified by a combination of the shallowing of the seabed and retarding of return flow (WMO, 2011; WMO, 2022).","altLabels":["Estuarine Flooding","Coastal inundation"],"typeId":"https://www.preventionweb.net/hips-type/meteorological-and-hydrological","typeName":"Meteorological and Hydrological","clusterId":"https://www.preventionweb.net/hips-cluster/water-related","clusterName":"Water-related","scopeNotes":{},"causes":["https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/gh0403","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/gh0405","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/mh0602","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/mh0604","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/en0106","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/en0301","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/bi0103","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/bi0110","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/tl0201","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/tl0203","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/tl0204","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/tl0207","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/tl0214","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/tl0301","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/tl0308","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/tl0404","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/tl0405","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/tl0503","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/tl0506","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/tl0511"],"causedBy":["https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/en0207","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/mh0309","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/mh0604","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/mh0701","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/mh0702","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/mh0703","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/mh0704","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/mh0705","https://www.undrr.org/terms/hips/gh0311"],"sources":["https://library.wmo.int/records/item/35881-manual-on-flood-forecasting-and-warning?offset=2","https://library.wmo.int/records/item/58169-guidelines-on-implementation-of-a-coastal-inundation-forecasting-early-warning-system"],"quotedFrom":["https://library.wmo.int/records/item/35881-manual-on-flood-forecasting-and-warning?offset=2","https://library.wmo.int/records/item/58169-guidelines-on-implementation-of-a-coastal-inundation-forecasting-early-warning-system"],"references":["#descriptionSource1","#descriptionSource2","#descriptionSource3","#descriptionSource4","#descriptionSource5","#descriptionSource6","#descriptionSource7","#descriptionSource8","#descriptionSource9","#descriptionSource10","https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/unclos_e.pdf","https://iris.who.int/handle/10665/232690","https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/108625","https://library.wmo.int/records/item/35881-manual-on-flood-forecasting-and-warning?offset=1","https://library.wmo.int/records/item/37094-coastal-and-delta-flood-management?offset=1"],"influencedBy":["#descriptionSource1","#descriptionSource2","#descriptionSource3","#descriptionSource4","#descriptionSource5","#descriptionSource6","#descriptionSource7","#descriptionSource8","#descriptionSource9","#descriptionSource10","https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/unclos_e.pdf","https://iris.who.int/handle/10665/232690","https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/108625","https://library.wmo.int/records/item/35881-manual-on-flood-forecasting-and-warning?offset=1","https://library.wmo.int/records/item/37094-coastal-and-delta-flood-management?offset=1"],"conformsTo":[],"hasPart":["#diagram1"],"related":[],"versionInfo":"2025 update;
